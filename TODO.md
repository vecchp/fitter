# Goals

* Use Dask to read data and distribute it across number of machines
* CVX opt seems to use all cores anyway though so this may be just across
  machines instead of just cores.

* Need a error bound definition
 * Absolute
 * Percentage based
 * Chebyschev polynomials
 
 
* Rat Fit
  * error bounds
  * normalize data for poly
  * data - lower bounds
  * data + upper bounds
